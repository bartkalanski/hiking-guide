# Hiking Guide

Hiking Guide is a web application which helps users to find trails near where they are based. As a keen hiker I had a lot of fun building this, it's Vanilla JS based and it was one of the last JS projects I built before I started to learn React. 

**Technologies Used:**

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Webpack
- OpenCage Geocoding API
- Hiking Project API
